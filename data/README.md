# Folder for hosting project datasets
If data exists in well defined sql tables there is no need to save the entire table here. The sample datasets that are used for analysis and modeling should however be included here.

## Organize datasets into:
1. s0 = The original, immutable data dump.
2. s1 = Intermediate data that has been transformed.
3. z = The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
